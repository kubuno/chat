# Changelog

All notable changes to **kubuno-chat** are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Entries are added under
`[Unreleased]` **as the change is made**; `_tools/release.sh` stamps them under the version
number at release time, and CI publishes that section as the GitHub Release notes.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Theme tokens: two colours for navigation labels (`--color-text-nav`,
  `--color-text-nav-active`). Every module carries the same token sheet, so the
  values must match across them — whichever bundle loads last would otherwise
  win. No visible change inside this module.

### Added

- A **mini-panel for the shell's right rail**: conversations with their unread counts,
  to see who is waiting and jump into the thread.

### Changed

- Default application background token aligned with the core (`--body-bg` `#f8fafd`). Only
  visible when the module runs standalone: inside the shell the active theme sets it.
